# matam-hw1-matamikya
a repo for matamikya part of the project
here we are going to contain only the parts relevant to matamikya part

# PLEASE DON'T WORK ON MASTER BRANCH!
We would make a new branch for each ###FUNCTION we will create - and than the merging should work fine with no conflicts!
### no one of us is merging to master branch for himself!
when one finish his work on function and want to merge to master - he creates a pull request.
the other is looking through the request and see the changes that made (and resolve conflicts if has to)
only than - approving the merge and making it.

##last thing - make every update (push,pull and all) through the website's GUI!!
working on these stuff in CLION can make things harder if something went wrong!
